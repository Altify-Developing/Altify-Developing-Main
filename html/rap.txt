Okay
You already know whats up
Put your glocks up
Get out them XDs
Put them FNs up
put your shit in the air for me
Fake beef what we dealin' wit
That broad that you chasing, I done already done her
House, trucks, big whips, baby we been did it
Then reports switch name-tags - we're the enemies
That's why you gotta ball every chance you get
I wanna fulfill the dreams, that my granddad homes had
So I spend the money to see it
Not just that, the style of Knights got ya actin' wild
And if you ain't got you better get
cuz we aint wit that actin shit
But I be on that active shit
Right there on that killin shit
Cuz I can't handle bitchin shit
I know I ain't no pastor
but this shit got me holy
then I jump right out the plane
with a two-tone on my ring
and I got all that bling
When we see them opps
You know its funeral day
For them boys with different colors
Its like death day everyday
shoot you up aint time to wait
get my bitch to clean my plate
You know gang gonna stay out late
Fuck that pussy get on knees
Charlie brown the way I ease
throw that football not time to wheeze
Can't see me giving no fake my cheese
Rap to the fullest, finna go hard
Cause and effect, smell the smoke and the breeze
