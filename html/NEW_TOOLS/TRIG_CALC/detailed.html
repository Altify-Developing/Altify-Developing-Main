<p><br>if 1 is your conjugator in this case m in the url, is equal to 1, you will get the following for req views to recieve payment: 130.71895424836603<br>the best thing to do in these positions is to recognize the fact that these are not whole numbers and to mentally only consider the whole number by rounding up, and also this is the general payment you recieve, not taking into mind the fact that this is also the average payment per view you would get if your channel didn't fit any category specifically, as youtube does not pay you for skipped ads, and they only pay you on a vbr (viewership based rate), the default 30% of youtube ads are skipped, that is the general amount for gaming, tutorials, and other shorter, younger crowds, the more likley to recieve less money, for a gaming video the skip rate is 87%, for a tutorial it is 94%. This data was measured by a annual youtube census in 2022, which many people did not participate in, which also makes it much more likely that you will not recieve as much money, so take the number you recieve with a grain of salt, and try to at least double it.</p>
